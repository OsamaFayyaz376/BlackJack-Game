# BlackJack-Game

In this task, I have made a simple black jack game, in which player can play against a dealer , initally the player will be given two cards, if the sum is less than 21 , player can choose to draw another card and continue playing.

Mainly, I have used javascript to add multiple fucntionalities in the game, the main concepts used are DOM Manipulation by getElementById and querySelector , i have also used arrays for storing cards and object to store Player Information. I have used array methods like reduce to calculate sum of cards in array.
